Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering is the application of software principles to design, develop, test, deploy and maintenan a software.
software engineering is important to the technology industry as it fosters innovation by providing methodologies and tools that help developers create software solutions.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
development of programming languages
rise of agile methodologies
establishment of software engineering as a discipline

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
requirements - researching what the user needs and system requirements 
design - creation of a software architecture and user interface
implementation - writing codes to create the software according to the design requirements 
testing - running different tests to ensure the software meets the standard requirements 
deployment - exposure of the software to the users
maintenance - involves the update and enhancements of the software after deployment 

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
waterfall involves the step by step guide of the software development life cycle example you research then design then test then you deploy and finally you implement. agile is a methodology that involves iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility and respond to change


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
a software developer writes codes and implements software solutions
a quality assurance engineer designs and executes tests to ensure and determine software quality
a project manager oversees the planning, execution and delivery of software projects

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging and testing codes example visual studio
Version Control Systems help in tracking changes ti source code and coordinate work among team groups example git

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
pressure to deliver software products within a given period of time
change in requirements during development cycle

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
unit testing involves testing of individual components of a software, integration testing involves testing interactions between different components, system testing involves testing of the entire software system as a whole while acceptance testing involves testing of the software against usee requirements to ensure it meets user needs. 
Testing helps identify and fix defects early in development process leading to higher quality software products.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
prompt engineering is the process of structuring the right, specific and concise question to get the right and correct feedback.
Prompt engineering facilitates an easy interaction between the user and the software.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
what is a internet of things 
explain what internet of things entail in a simple language.
The vague prompt will provide a plain answer while the concise prompt will expound the question asked in a greater depth and in easy to understand words
